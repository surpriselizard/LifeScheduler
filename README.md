# ReminderProjectWPF
A port of my previous Reminder Project but now in WPF instead of the console.

This project will let you store reminders that have a name, desription, and date due.  
You will also be able to view your reminders by themselves or display the reminders 
in the week ahead or even the reminders in the current month. 

As said before this project is a new version of a previous project where it was 
only in the console. Now there are a number of menus and popups so it will be 
much more user friendly, better looking, more functional, and hopefully more
features!
