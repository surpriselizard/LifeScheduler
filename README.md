A port of my previous Reminder Project but now in WPF instead of the console.

This project will let you store reminders that have a name, description, and date. You will be able to see your reminders in the current week, previous week, or next week.

As opposed to the console version of this project, there is a GUI that makes for a easier, and more streamlined experinece.

This project was renamed from ReminderProjectWPF to LifeScheduler to better fit the vision of the project while aslo being less technical
